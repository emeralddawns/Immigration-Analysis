Note: Includes Amerasian immigrants except in Fiscal Years 1980 to 1988. Data from the Department of State (DOS) Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System (WRAPS) on refugee arrivals differ slightly from the Department of Homeland Security’s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics due to a different data collection approach. ,,
